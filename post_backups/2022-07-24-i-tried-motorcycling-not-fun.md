# I live in

I live in a third-world country. Motorcycles are the go-to vehicles here. They're:

1. Cheap
2. Good at lessening traffic headaches

So, I decided to try riding one. Used to take the jeepney to uni, but I figured it was time to keep what sanity I have left and ditch public transportation.

That was the plan, anyway. Never thought it'd be challenging. They always say "it's just like riding a bicycle." Well, let me tell you, it was absolutely nothing like riding a bike.

But hey, whatever, I'll probably get the hang of it eventually.
