I've got this weird knackâ€”it can turn me from the happiest person ever to the most down-in-the-dumps, self-pitying individual. Usually, I'm all about thinking rationally (and staying upbeat). But then, there are those days when I get hit with this feeling that I'm just not measuring up or doing enough. It's like a rollercoaster ride between confidence and self-doubt.

But this feeling will pass.. as it always does.
