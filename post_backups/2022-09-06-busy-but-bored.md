Quite a weird feeling, really. One day, you're just twiddling your thumbs out of sheer boredom, and then bam, the next day you're knee-deep in stuff that keeps you occupied for hours.

People say boredom's got its perks, that it lets your mind wander and reflect. And sure, that might fly in some cases, but for me, boredom's just a big ol' bucket of 'unproductive.' It's more likely to stir up anxiety than anything remotely insightful.

Anyway, I've been in this funky state of busy-bored for the past few weeks. It's like I couldn't get around to doing anything else. But lucky me, I finally got a little break, and guess what? I've got a solid chunk of time now to dive into my side projects (even if it's just for a day, gotta take what you can get).

# Epic medieval ambience

So, get thisâ€”I stumbled upon these "medieval music" compilations in my recommended feed yesterday. The thumbnails had this cool vibe, so naturally, I had to give them a click. Now, I'm not exactly a die-hard ASMR fan, but there's something oddly satisfying about these (though I'm not entirely sure if they fall under ASMR; I mean, some videos even have "ASMR Ambience" in the title, so go figure).
