# I live in

I live in a third-world country. Motorcycles are the go-to vehicles here. They're:

1. Cheap
2. Tad less traffic pain
3. You get to smell your surroundings (exhaust smoke yum)

And so I tried learning one. I was commuting to uni before this, so I decided I would finally let my sanity back by saying _sayonara_ to all the packed and **_shtingky_** jeepneys.

That was the plan, anyway. Never thought it would be this hard. They always say "it's just like riding a bicycle." It totally did NOT feel like riding a plain ol' bike. Controlling the throttle was one thing, now I have to learn 700 different bits and pieces just to 'familiarize' how the whole thing works. Nah fam, I don't think I will.

But anyway, I'll probably do alright. Here's a bike-related meme though.
