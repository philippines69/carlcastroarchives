# I live in 

I live in a third-world country. Motorcycles are the go-to vehicles here. It's:

1. Cheap
2. Traffic is a bit more painless (you zoom past it)
3. You get to smell your surroundings (exhaust smoke yum)

And so I tried learning to ride one. I was commuting to uni before this, and so decided to love my body (and sanity) more by saying _sayonara_ to all the packed and _shtingky_ jeepneys.

That was the plan, anyway. Never thought it would be this hard though. Controlling the throttle was one thing, now I have to learn 700 different bits and parts just to 'familiarize' how the whole thing works. Nah fam, I don't think I will.

But anyways, I'll probably do alright. Here's a bike-related meme though.
