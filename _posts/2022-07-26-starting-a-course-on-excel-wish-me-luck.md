# Getting good

So, starting from today, I'm diving into learning some skills that might actually come in handy down the line. Top of the stack? Getting cozy with Excel. I've brushed against it before, but now it's time for a real deep dive to amp up my skills.

I'll mainly be learning from these sources:

* [Excel Practice Online](https://excel-practice-online.com/functions/excel_basics/)
* [ExcelIsFun Basics Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrRPvpgDmw0n34OMHeS94epMaX_Y8Tu1k)

Wish me luckðŸ’ª
