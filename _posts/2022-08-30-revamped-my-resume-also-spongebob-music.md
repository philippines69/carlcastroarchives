# Resume done, can I sleep now

I've been putting off working on this thing and now it's finally done.

This ain't the first time I made myself a resume. Although I made the first one when I was 16 so you can expect some weird, out-of-place stuff teenage me thought of putting on.

I've been relying on my cover letter ever since I started. Now that I have a resume, would it somewhat help me in my job search?

# In other news, Spongebob music apparently promotes relaxation in some parts of the brain
