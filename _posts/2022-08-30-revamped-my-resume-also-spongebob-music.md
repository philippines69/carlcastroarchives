# Resume done, can I sleep now

Now, I've been putting off working on this thing and finally, it's about done.

This isn't the first time I made a resume, but the first one was made when I was 16 so you'd expect some weird, out-of-place stuff that teenage me thought of putting on.

I've been relying on my cover letter rather than on my resume since I started; Now that I have one, will this help me score more gigs? (God I hope so)

# In other breaking news, Spongebob music promotes relaxation in some parts of the brain; try it for yourself!
