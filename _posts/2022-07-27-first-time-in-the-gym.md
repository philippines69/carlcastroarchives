My very first time at the gym was quite something.

Right after I filled out the form, this really fit dude comes up to me. I'm guessing he's gonna be the one showing me the ropes? Usually, you'd have to pay for that kind of help, but he's offering it for free, so I'm going along with it.

He showed me the ropes and taught me how to use the equipment. There were lots of equipment to get around, surprisingly enough. The membership fee was so cheap I thought it'd be a rundown gym with incomplete equipment.

Anyways, one key takeaway I can get from this is that I'm so WEAK. But, even pros come from humble beginnings, right? So I guess I should just power through this.

Let's see where this'll take me and hopefully my P300 membership fee won't go to waste
