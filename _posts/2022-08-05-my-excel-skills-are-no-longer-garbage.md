I've actually come a long way since my previous post about this ([here](https://www.carlcastroarchives.ml/started-learning-some-excel/)). I won't claim to be a whiz just yet, but there's definitely been some improvement.

I'm currently diving into the [Excel Basics Free Course by ExcelIsFun](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrRPvpgDmw0n34OMHeS94epMaX_Y8Tu1k). Turns out, learning this stuff wasn't exactly a walk in the park. Once I'm through with this, I've got my sights set on getting into Quickbooks or something along those lines.
