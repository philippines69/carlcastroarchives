I've made some considerable progress since my last post (can be found [here](https://www.carlcastroarchives.ml/started-learning-some-excel/)). I still ain't good by any means, but at least I've improved a little bit. 

I'm following the [Excel Basics Free Course by ExcelIsFun](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrRPvpgDmw0n34OMHeS94epMaX_Y8Tu1k). I underestimated its complexity; didn't know it'd be difficult to learn. Though I believe the best way to learn is by doing, so maybe someone should start hiring me for jobs involving Excel! That would accelerate the learning process!

After this, I'm hoping to start learning Quickbooks or something similar. Anyways, goodbye!ðŸ‘‹
