Life. The life we have right now.

In all my years, never once have I experienced death in close proximity. Was I a privileged bastard? Maybe. But then 2022 came and morphed into an edgy teenager thinking he's so cool 'cause he's built differently. It's been a rough year.

I have no idea what my point is exactly. This night's just different, as another person very dear to me has departed. After hearing the news, something inside me simply just _snapped_; all my worries felt meaningless in an instant. I felt existential enlightenment. It felt like this year has been so shit on the grander scale that my problems felt so.. _small_. I think it'll wear out though, that's why I quickly opened Forestry and wrote down my thoughts.

Life's so fragile. In one moment something might happen that would fuck up everything you've been trying to build your entire life.

Maybe there's a reason why the quote above is so overused. Maybe all those 'motivational speakers' were right and maybe they were onto something.

What I just said was pretty cliche but naaaaahh enlightenment is such a rare experience so I'd rather **make the most out of it**. Byeüëã
