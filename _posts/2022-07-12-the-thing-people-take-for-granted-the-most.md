I realized there's one thing EVERYONE's been taking for granted (aside from monks I guess). Life. The life we have right now.

In all my years, never once have I experienced death in close proximity. Was I a privileged bastard? Maybe. But then 2022 came and morphed into an edgy teenager thinking he's so cool 'cause he's built differently _(mass shootings, COVID,_ [_Sana_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsUj0dszADCGbF3gNrQEuSQ)_'s graduation, and now you're telling me another relative's dead?)_ It's been a rough year.

I have no idea what my point is exactly. This night's just different, as another person very dear to me has departed. After hearing the news, something inside me simply just _snapped_; all my worries felt meaningless in an instant. I felt "existential enlightenment." It felt like this year has been so shit on the grander scale that my problems felt so.. _small_. I think it'll wear out though, that's why I quickly opened Forestry and wrote down my thoughts.

Life's so fragile. In one moment something might happen that would fuck up everything you've been building your entire life.

Maybe there's a good reason why the quote is so worn out. Maybe all those 'motivational speakers' were right and maybe they were onto something.

What I just said was pretty cliche but naaaaahh enlightenment is such a rare experience so I'd rather **make the most out of it**. Byeüëã

_Forgive me my thoughts are quite jumbled I can't relay them properly bruh lmao istg ngl tho_
