Life. The life we have right now.

In all my years, never once have I experienced death in close proximity. Was I a privileged bastard? Maybe. But then 2022 came and decided to morph into an angsty teenager who thinks he's so cool and built different. It's been a rough year.

I have no idea what my point is exactly. This night's just different, as another person very dear to me has departed. After hearing the news, something inside me simply just _snapped_; all my worries felt meaningless in an instant. I felt existential enlightenment. I think it'll wear out though, that's why I quickly opened Forestry and wrote down my thoughts.

What I just said was pretty cliche but naaaaahh enlightenment is such a rare experience so I'd rather make the most out of it.
