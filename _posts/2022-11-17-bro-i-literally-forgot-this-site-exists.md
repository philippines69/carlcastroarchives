### Guess who's back?

Wow, looking back at last month, it's like a whirlwind hit me. I swear, I've gone through so many changes that I feel like an entirely different person now.

But let's talk real life stuffâ€”I'm pretty much broke right now. So, I've gone into full hustle mode, sending out proposals left and right, hoping to land something decent. I even gave my Upwork and OLJ profiles a major overhaul (again). The old versions were just way too messy.

As for this site, well, I'll try to pop in more often. College is a massive drain on both my time and my mental energy, so it's a bit of a juggling act.

Wish me luck I guess?
