It hit me recently that I've been quietly watching and dissecting how folks navigate various situations and moments in time. It's honestly mind-boggling to witness the gears turning inside people's heads, to see how they respond to others, different scenarios, and their own selves.

And then it hit me againâ€”maybe delving into the world of Psychology could be a way to satisfy this endless curiosity about the human mind. But, there's a bit of a snag. I'm already deep into an Engineering course, and let's be real, Engineering's usually got a bit more cash in the wallet than Psychology. So, I'm thinking I might let this simmer on the back burner for a while and see where this engineering path takes me. Who knows, maybe there's a way to blend both worlds down the line?
