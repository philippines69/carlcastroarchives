Just started university. Hooray!ðŸ¥³

These last few weeks have been weird. I started gymming, started uni, and now I'm typing this out with notes and highlighters on my desk. Is my life finally changing for the better?

Anyway,the schedule's pretty tight and I'm still adjusting to my new environment. I made a lot of new friends; some came from different schools and some even came from nearby provinces. It's been quite exciting! 

Will I survive and get an engineering degree? Let's see in a few years, I guess!
