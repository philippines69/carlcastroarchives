I've been working on this site for months now. And honestly? **Jekyll** has been a pain in the butt. Take note, my experience with web development was basically ZERO before this. 

But hey, you're reading this right now, so I guess it all worked out in the end!

Don't get me wrong, this was an awesome learning experience. I've learned a lot of **CSS**, **HTML**, and some **Javascript** as well. I'm starting to think I should scrap my plans of becoming an engineer and transition into a webdev instead! It's actually quite fun!
