I've been working on this site for months now. And honestly? Installing [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) was a colossal pain in the butt. Take note, my experience with web development was ZERO before this, so you can imagine the amount of head-scratching and face-palming before I could get it up and running.

But hey, you're reading this right now, so I guess it all worked out in the end!

Don't get me wrong; this was an excellent learning experience. I've learned a lot of [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css), [**HTML**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), and some [**Javascript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript). Maybe I should scrap my plans on becoming an engineer and transition into web dev instead! It's quite fun! (I'm kidding. Or am I?)

_I think I'll make a post detailing the short but painful journey it took to launch this blog. It'll come out Soon Enough_â„¢
