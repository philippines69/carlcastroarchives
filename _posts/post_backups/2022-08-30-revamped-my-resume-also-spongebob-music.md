# Resume done, can I sleep now

I've been procrastinating on getting this thing done, but guess what? It's finally crossed off my list.

This isn't my first go at crafting a resume. Nope, I actually whipped up my very first one when I was just 16. You can only imagine the odd assortment of things teenage me decided to throw in there.

I've mostly been banking on my cover letter up until now. But with an actual resume in hand, do you think it might give my job search a bit of a boost?
