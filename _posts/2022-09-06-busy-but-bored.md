# Busy-bored?

Quite a weird feeling, really. One day you're bored, but then the next day you'll be doing stuff all day you'd wonder why there're only 24 hours in a day. Is this what I'll be experiencing in the next 4 years?

They say boredom is necessary to let our minds reflect and wander. That's might be true in some cases, but to me, boredome feels like I'm unproductive, and so it only induces anxiety more than anything else.

Anyways, I've been busy-bored these past few weeks that I couldn't apply to jobs on Upwork and all that. Good thing I was recently able to catch one of those "bored" days of mine and now I have ample time to work on the freelancing stuff (for a day of course, tomorrow seems very busy).

# Dang, medieval ambience?

Yesterday I discovered these "medieval music" compilations on my YouTube recommendations and thought the thumbnails looked cool so I clicked on it. Really liked it. I'm not really into 'ASMR' and all of its subgenres but this one's quite good (dunno if it counts as ASMR, but some videos include "ASMR Ambience" in the title so yeah).
