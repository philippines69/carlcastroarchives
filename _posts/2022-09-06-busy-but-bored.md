# Busy-bored??

Quite a weird feeling, really. One day you’re bored, but then the next day, you’d be doing stuff for hours on end. Is this what I’ll be experiencing for the next 4 years?

They say boredom is necessary to let our minds reflect and wander. That might be true in some cases, but to me, boredom feels soo ‘unproductive.’ So it only induces anxiety more than anything else.

Anyways, I’ve been busy-bored these past few weeks that I couldn’t apply to jobs on Upwork and all that. Good thing I was recently able to catch one of those “bored” days of mine, and now I have ample time to work on the freelancing stuff (only for a day of course).

# Dang, medieval ambience?

Yesterday I discovered these “medieval music” compilations on my recommendations and thought the thumbnails looked cool, so I clicked on them. I’m not really into ‘ASMR’ and all of its subgenres but this one’s quite good (dunno if this counts as ASMR though; some videos include “ASMR Ambience” in the title so yeah).
