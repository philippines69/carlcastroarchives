This ability of mine can make me switch from the happiest person on earth to the most depressed and self-pitying prick in a matter of milliseconds

Seriously though, I dunno anymore. I usually think rationally (and positively). But there are just days when I feel I'm not doing enough/I'm not enough.

I end up feeling like a mess.

But this feeling will pass.. as it previously did.
