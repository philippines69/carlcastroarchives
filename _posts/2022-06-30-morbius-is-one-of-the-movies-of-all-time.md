Last night, I was faced with a predicament; I had to pick a good movie to watch. I watched it with my 'lil bro, so it must be something BOTH of us could enjoy.

And of course, as what anyone with a sane mind would do, I chose the hit movie '**_Morbius_**.'

Of all the Marvel movies, Morbius is definitely one of them.

The runtime of 1 hour and 44 minutes simply wasn't enough. But I GUESS it's fine as long as they're working on a sequel.
