# Choosing to Morb

Last night, I was faced with a predicament: picking a good movie to play on the TV. Oh, what a tragedy. Tons of Hollywood films to choose from!

Hmmmmmm Hollywood. _Hmmmmmmmmmm_ Marvel! And so, I browsed for a movie from Marvel's growing (and confusing) lineup of films.

Aaaand I chose '**_Morbius_**.' Why? I just thought it'd be funny.

Of all the Marvel movies, I'd say Morbius is definitely one of them. The runtime of 1 hour and 44 minutes simply wasn't enough. But I GUESS it's fine as long as they're working on a sequel.

# Well Carl, how was it?

It was sh&ast;t. 

_I rate it a Morbillion/10_.
