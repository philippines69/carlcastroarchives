# Choosing to Morb

Last night, I was faced with a predicament: picking a good movie to play on the TV. Oh, what a dilemma. Tons of western films to choose from!

"Western. Hollywood. Hmmmm. Marvel!" And so I narrowed down my picks and browsed Marvel's growing (and increasingly complicated) lineup of films.

Aaaand I chose '**_Morbius_**.' Why? I thought it'd be funny.

Of all the Marvel movies, I'd say Morbius is definitely one of them. The runtime of 1 hour and 44 minutes simply wasn't enough. But I GUESS it's fine as long as they're working on a sequel.

Boring. Pretty sh*t. Go watch it.
