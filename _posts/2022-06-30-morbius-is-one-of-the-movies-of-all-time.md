# Movie Night

Last night, I was faced with a predicament: picking a good movie to play for the family. Oh what a tragedy. There are tons of Hollywood films to choose from!

Hmm Hollywood. _Hmmmmmmmmmm_ Marvel! And so, I chose to go with one of Marvel's confusing lineup of films.

And of course, as what anyone with a sane mind would do, I chose the hit movie '**_Morbius_**.'

Of all the Marvel movies, Morbius is definitely one of them.

The runtime of 1 hour and 44 minutes simply wasn't enough. But I GUESS it's fine as long as they're working on a sequel.
