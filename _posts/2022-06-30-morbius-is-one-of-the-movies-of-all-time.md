Last night's thursday, and you know what that means! (I know you don't) Movie night! I FINALLY watched Marvel's _'**Morbius**.'_ And I'd say, out of all the Marvel movies, Morbius is definitely one of them.

The runtime of 1 hour and 44 minutes simply wasn't enough. But I GUESS it's fine as long as they're working on a sequel.

**I rate this movie a Morbillion/10**
