# Who I am..

You can call me Carl! I'm an engineering freshman (if it adds to anything) living in Zamboanga Peninsula, Philippines. I created this blog/site as an avenue to display my skills/experiences/quirks in a more 'personalized' way.

# ...Freelancer

I do this mainly for my folks at home (sounds clich√©, I know). I'm still figuring out what I'd like to do in this wide (and scary) world that is freelancing, so I've been trying a lot of stuff in the past year. Learn more about this [here.]() 

# ...Electronics Enthusiast

I just love tinkering with electronics. That's why I said, "screw it" and chose to pursue an EE degree. My good father's an electronics technician, so you can see where I got my enthusiasm from. 

# ...Scriptwriter

Nothing fancy, just wrote scripts for a couple of YouTube channels. I started in late October of 2021 and it's been ongoing ever since. The job's been a great learning experience for me; I'd like to think it helped improve my hopeless grammar. Writing scripts for dirt-cheap has also primed my skills for freelancing work, as connecting with clients helped me be more 'sociable.'

# ...Trusty Digital Wingman

A fancy way of saying 'Virtual Assistant.'
