# About Me: A Brief Overview...

Hi, you can call me Carl. I post on this site occasionally...

# ...Exploring the Freelancing World

As I navigate the world of freelance work, I'm currently in the process of discovering my interests and trying out various gigs to find my path.

# ...Passion for Electronics and Tech

I really enjoy electronics, which is why I'm pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering. It runs in the family.

# ...Scriptwriter

I've been writing scripts for clients since 2021. The job's been a great learning experience for me; it's pretty cool connecting with different types of people.

# ...Virtual Assistant Duties

I've also worked as a virtual assistant, helping people with different tasks. It was my first freelance job, and I gained a good grasp of basic tools and practices, as well as learned from various customer interactions.

# ...Web dev newbie

For this website, I chose to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a tool for creating websites using simple text files. The site is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), which I decided to switch to from Netlify due to its features. To make writing blog posts easier, I use a tool called [Forestry](https://forestry.io/).

I'm still new to a lot of this, so I'm using a design called [Klis√©](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise).

# ...My Love for Anime

I can't help but mention that I'm a big fan of anime. I got into it in 2020. You can find my anime list on AniList below.
