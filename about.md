# Who I am...

You can call me Carl! I'm an engineering freshman (if it adds to anything) living in Zamboanga Peninsula, Philippines. I created this blog/site as an avenue to display my skills/experiences/quirks in a more 'personalized' way.

# ...Freelancer

I do this mainly for my folks at home (sounds cliché, I know). I'm still figuring out what I'd like to do in this wide (and scary) world that is freelancing, so I've been trying a lot of stuff in the past year. Learn more about this [here.]()

# ...Electronics geek

I just love tinkering with electronics. That's why I said, "screw it" and chose to pursue an EE degree. My good father's an electronics technician, so you can see where I got my enthusiasm from.

# ...Scriptwriter

Nothing fancy, just wrote scripts for a couple of YouTube channels. I started in late October of 2021 and it's been ongoing ever since. The job's been a great learning experience for me; I'd like to think it helped improve my hopeless grammar. Writing scripts for dirt-cheap has also primed my skills for freelancing work, as connecting with clients helped me be more 'sociable.'

# ...Trusty digital wingman

A pretentious way of saying 'Virtual assistant.' I worked as an assistant for a family member's online business. Got a better grasp on the basic apps such as Google Docs, Sheets, and Gmail. I also worked with customer fulfillment; I've had my fair share of experiences with all types of customers. It was still a fun experience nevertheless.

# ...Web dev newbie

I chose to build this site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/); a static site generator used to build websites using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript). I'm hosting it on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). I used to host it on Netlify, but I chose to migrate since I've also been using Cloudflare's CDN. And yeah, to make blogging a bit more painless, I use a CMS called [Forestry](https://forestry.io/).

I'm basically still a toddler for these things, so I used a theme called [Klisé](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise). Could've used something better-documented, but something about this theme just made me fall in love with it.

# ...Music/Anime normie

I HAD to mention it. It's part of who I am! Find my music recs [here](https://www.carlcastroarchives.ml/archive/#Music). And my anime (AniList) profile's down below.
