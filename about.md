The name's Carl Robin Castro. Call me Carl! I'm an engineering freshman (if that adds to anything) living in Zamboanga Peninsula, Philippines. I created this blog/site as an avenue to better display my skills/experiences/quirks in a more 'personalized' way. 

This site is powered by [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator used to build websites using [**Markdown**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), [**HTML**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css), and [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript). I'm hosting it on [**Cloudflare Pages**](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). I used to host it on Netlify, but I chose to migrate since I've also been using Cloudflare's CDN. And yeah, to make blogging just a tad bit painless, I'm using a CMS called [**Forestry**](https://forestry.io/). Some weird bugs here and there, but pretty cool stuff.
