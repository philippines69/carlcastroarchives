# Who I am...

Hi, you can call me Carl! I occasionally post on this site..

# ...Freelancer

I'm still figuring out what I'd like to do in the world of freelancing, so I've been trying a lot of stuff.

# ...Electronics...Geek?

I like electronics. That's why I'm pursuing an EE degree. I guess it runs in the family.

# ...Scriptwriter

I write scripts for a couple of clients. It started back in October 2021. The job's been a great learning experience for me. It's pretty cool connecting with different types of people.

# ...Trusty digital wingman

A pretentious way of saying 'Virtual assistant.' My first gig was a Virtual assistance job. Got a better grasp on the basic apps and practices. I also had my fair share of experiences with customers.

# ...Web dev newbie

I chose to build this site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/); a static site generator used to build websites using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript). I'm hosting it on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). I used to host it on Netlify, but I chose to migrate since I've also been using Cloudflare's CDN. To make blogging a bit more painless, I use a CMS called [Forestry](https://forestry.io/).

I'm still a newbie for these things, so I chose to use a theme called [Klis√©](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise).

# ...Anime normie

I just HAD to mention it. It's part of who I am! I started back in 2020. Find my anime (AniList) profile down below.
