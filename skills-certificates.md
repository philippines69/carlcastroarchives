# Who I am...

You can call me Carl! I'm an engineering freshman (if that adds to anything) living in Zamboanga Peninsula, Philippines. I created this blog/site as an avenue to display my skills/experiences/quirks in a more 'personalized' way.

# ...Freelancer

I do this mainly for my folks at home. I'm still figuring out what I'd like to do in this wide world of freelancing, so I've been trying a lot of stuff in the past year. Learn more about this [here.]()

# ...Electronics...Geek?

I like electronics. That's why I'm pursuing an EE degree. My dad's a technician for electronics, so I guess it runs in the family.

# ...Scriptwriter

Nothing fancy, just wrote scripts for a couple of YouTube channels. It started in October 2021. The job's been a great learning experience for me; It helped improve my grammar. Writing scripts for dirt-cheap also primed my skills for freelancing work. It was cool connecting with different types of clients.

# ...Trusty digital wingman

A pretentious way of saying 'Virtual assistant.' I worked as an assistant for a relative's online business. Got a better grasp on the basic apps such as Google Docs, Sheets, and Gmail. I also had my fair share of experiences with all types of customers.

# ...Web dev newbie

I chose to build this site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/); a static site generator used to build websites using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript). I'm hosting it on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). I used to host it on Netlify, but I chose to migrate since I've also been using Cloudflare's CDN. To make blogging a bit more painless, I use a CMS called [Forestry](https://forestry.io/).

I'm still a toddler for these things, so I chose to use a theme called [Klis√©](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise).

# ...Anime normie

I just HAD to mention it. It's part of who I am! Pretty new to this; started back in 2020. Find my anime (AniList) profile down below.
