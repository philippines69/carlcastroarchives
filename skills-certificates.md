# TV show recaps & summaries

I worked as a scriptwriter for a TV show recaps channel. I'm currently working on a project involving recaps/summaries of a famous TV show you've probably already heard of (Game of Thrones).

# Ancient history

I've also dabbled in some Ancient Egyptian history to show off my love for ancient times.

# Facts & biographies

This is one of my first gigs as a channel writer, but this was also my longest-running one (so far).

I learned a lot from this gig and I'm forever grateful to the person who accepted me for the opportunity.
