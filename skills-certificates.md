TV show recaps & summaries
</h1></div>

I worked as a scriptwriter for a TV show recaps channel. I'm currently working on a project involving recaps/summaries of a famous TV show you've probably already heard of (Game of Thrones).

I've also dabbled in some Ancient Egyptian history to show off my love for ancient times.

This is one of my first gigs as a channel writer, but this was also my longest-running one (so far).

I learned a lot from this gig and I'm forever grateful to the person who accepted me for the opportunity.
